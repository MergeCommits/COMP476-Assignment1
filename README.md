# Characteristics
Each team chooses a member in the home area to move to the enemy teamâ€™s flag and return to their home area. The first team to bring the enemy flag home wins.

Team members that are not assigned to the flag wander. If an enemy goes into their territory then one of the wandering members is told to freeze them. A member may also be assigned to enter the enemy territory to unfreeze an ally and then return home.
